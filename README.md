#### 🌧️ Rain Alert – Never Get Caught in the Rain Again!

**Overview:**
Rain Alert is a simple yet powerful Python project that automatically **notifies you if it's going to rain** in your area. By integrating weather API services and a messaging system, it ensures you're always prepared before stepping out.

#### 🔧 Features:

* **Live weather data** via OpenWeatherMap API (or similar).
* Checks for **rain conditions** at regular intervals.
* Sends an **SMS alert** using Twilio API (or email using SMTP).
* Customizable location, alert message, and frequency.
* Lightweight and suitable for automation with cron or task scheduler.

---

#### 🛠️ Tech Stack:

* Python
* Requests (for API calls)
* `dotenv` (to hide API keys)
* Twilio / SMTP (for messaging)
* OpenWeatherMap API (or any weather service)

---

#### 🚀 How It Works:

1. Fetches current or forecasted weather using the location provided.
2. Parses the response to check if **"rain"** is mentioned in the weather conditions.
3. If rain is expected, sends an alert to the user (SMS/email).
4. Can be run daily using a cron job or task scheduler.

#### 🔐 Security Note:

All API keys and secrets are stored securely in a `.env` file and excluded from version control using `.gitignore`.

#### 📦 Use Cases:

* Commuters and cyclists who rely on weather updates.
* Parents sending kids to school.
* Travelers and delivery personnel.
* Smart home integrations (e.g., controlling windows/awnings).
